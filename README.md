<details>

<summary>Item 1 - What is the Circus</summary>

Without looking at everyone else's answer (too much) describe what you think of as "The Circus" as you view it.
* Be as thorough as possible, and as specific as you want to be
* Bonus points for whoever can do it in the fewest characters

```

<summary>Item 2 - Questions about the people</summary>

Ask yourself these three questions for a set of people (try to get 5, but no limit)
* You might be surprised in how confident you feel about each one
* Some of them are clearly "So impossible that my life would be different" or similar, but try to really spell it out

Fill out the form for anyone you want, pick those people you think would be interesting, but this is a possible list:
1. A Mod who isn't you (or all the Mods who aren't you)
2. Someone who is a constant participant with the Circus (e.g. people on the Elite CaW list)
3. A member who is an occational participant (e.g. people around some of the times, maybe hit that "!lurk")
4. Anyone who is picked up by the StreamCord bot in Discord
5. Someone with a CaW but you're not quite sure how long that'll be true
6. A person who left this discord, whether walking or booted (you'll need to do some past tense)

[given]

[departure reasons]
```

Example

```
## The Circus according to **Negative**

### What are they expected to provide to the Circus?
Misfits Member, the masked female Zero, in some ways a "filler" but also important to the people who know she is

### What do they expect to get out of being part of the Circus?
I suppose existing, for without the Circus, she wouldn't be here

### What would make them leave the Circus?
On one hand, easy answer is "the delete key" but if Negative is ever not around, things are really different than they are right now (or we found a hilarious "win or go home" match type)

<summary>Item 3 - The initial review</summary>

After you attempt the questions for a few people you might feel like you need to go re-check something, because something is off.

If you work on a few more, you might feel a few ideas click

What this may eventually lead to is your thoughts becoming crystallized around the question of "**What is the Circus?**" from Item 1.

There's no wrong answer if you keep thinking
